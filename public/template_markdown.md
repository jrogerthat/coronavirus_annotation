## Links

### Dealing with URL's
Ampersands in particular are bedeviling for web writers. If you want to write about ‘AT&T’, you need to write ‘AT&amp;T’. You even need to escape ampersands within URLs. Thus, if you want to link to:

http://images.google.com/images?num=30&q=larry+bird

you need to encode the URL as:

http://images.google.com/images?num=30&amp;q=larry+bird


### Link 

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.
