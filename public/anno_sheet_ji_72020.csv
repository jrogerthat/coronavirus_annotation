00:00-00:16,,citation,"Numbers of viral proteins: 100 S proteins, 20 E pentamers (100 proteins), 1000 M dimers (2000 proteins), 1000 N proteins","Yinon M Bar-On, Avi Flamholz, Rob Phillips, Ron Milo. Science Forum: SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) by the numbers. eLife 2020;9:e57309 DOI: 10.7554/eLife.57309",https://elifesciences.org/articles/57309,
00:00-00:16,,structure,Full-length glycosylated S protein model was downloaded from CHARMM-GUI. This model was modified from PDB 6VSB. The animation shows a 'breathing' motion where different subunits are in the 'up' state at different times. The relative length of time that the subunits should spend in the up state was uncertain.,,http://www.charmm-gui.org/?doc=archive&lib=covid19,
00:00-00:16,,structure,M protein dimer and E protein pentamers were downloaded from Feig lab repository,,https://github.com/feiglab/sars-cov-2-proteins/tree/master/Membrane,
00:08-00:16,,structure,"Full-length N protein model was downloaded from Zhang lab repository and arranged in octamers as described in Chen et al 2007. N and C terminus were rotated and moved relative to one another in the animation to avoid steric clashes. This assumes a flexible attachment between N and C lobes. Significant uncertainty about the structure of RNP; not clear how flexible RNP should be, whether it should be branched, etc.","Chun-Yuan Chen, Chung-ke Chang, Yi-Wei Chang, Shih-Che Sue, Hsin-I Bai, Lilianty Riang, Chwan-Deng Hsiao, and Tai-huang Huang. Structure of the SARS Coronavirus Nucleocapsid Protein RNA-binding Dimerization Domain Suggests a Mechanism for Helical Packaging of Viral RNA.

00:08-00:16,,structure,30kb RNA should be around 9000 nm long. There is less than that in this animation; I wasn't sure how much RNA might not be tightly bound by N protein.,,,
00:17-01:00,,note,"Cell surface proteins: ACE2 (purple), TMPRSS2 (orange), furin (yellow) ",,,
00:17-01:00,,structure,ACE2 is created using PDB 6M17 and animated as having a flexible 'neck' to allow for tilted angle when binding to S protein.,,http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6m17,
00:17-01:00,,structure,TMPRSS2 was created using a model from the PhyreRisk repository. A 13nm flexible linker was added and linked to a transmembrane domain.,,http://phyrerisk.bc.ic.ac.uk/search?action=fresh-search&searchTerm=TMPRSS2,
00:17-01:00,,structure,"Furin model was created using PDB 1P8J (catalytic and protease domain), with a 42nm linker to a transmembrane domain added",,https://www.rcsb.org/structure/1p8j,
00:29-00:43,,event,"ACE2 on the cell membrane capture S proteins when they are in the ""up"" state. In the animation, an ACE dimer is shown binding to a S protein. Whether all three S proteins need to be bound for infection to occur is not clear. The number of Spikes that are engaged by ACE2 is also uncertain.",,,
00:45-01:00,,event,"S proteins are cleaved by furin at the S1/S2 site, and by TMPRSS2 at the S2' site. In the animation, cleavages are indicated by flashes of light. Each S protein is shown undergoing both cleavage events.","Dorothea Bestle, Miriam Ruth Heindl, Hannah Limburg, Thuy Van Lam van, Oliver Pilgram, Hong Moulton, David A. Stein, Kornelia Hardes, Markus Eickmann, Olga Dolnik, Cornelius Rohde, Stephan Becker, Hans-Dieter Klenk, Wolfgang Garten, Torsten Steinmetzer, Eva Böttcher-Friebertshäuser. TMPRSS2 and furin are both essential for proteolytic activation and spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human airway epithelial cells and provide promising drug targets.

01:00-01:10,,structure,S protein prefusion structure is from PDB 6VSB (residues 816-1273). S protein pre-hairpin intermediate model was created by Jason McClellan. The animated transition is speculative.,,https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6VSB,
